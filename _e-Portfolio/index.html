					As a recent graduate from Southwestern Illinois College in Belleville,
					IL. I am excited to begin my career in the field of computer
					programming. While working towards my goals in getting my degree in
					computer informations I blossomed like a phoenix rising from the ashes
					for I finally found my true calling. I look forward to putting my
					education and aquired skills to use in this field. I am excited to
					continue developing my skills and gaining valuable experiences through
					future career opportunites.
