			<h2>Why should you choose computer programming?</h2>
			<p>
				The benefits of choosing to become a computer programmer are
				numerous,<br />
				some of which are high pay, a high growing feild, a wide range of career
				<br />
				options, creative and intellectually challenging work, opportunities for
				<br />
				advancement.
			</p>
			<h2>Where did it all begin?</h2>
			<p>
				"According to many people, the first computer programmer was the
				English<br />
				noblewoman Ada Lovelace. In 1843, she published a sequence of steps
				to<br />
				perform using a computing machine designed by her friend, Charles<br />
				Babbage. These notes are considered the first computer program."<br />
				"The program that Ada Lovelace wrote was for Charles Babbage's
				"Analytical<br />
				Engine", a mechanical general-purpose computer he designed, but never<br />
				completed. The design included memory, an arithmetic logic unit<br />
				(processor), and control flow for looping. This means it would have
				had<br />
				all of the key elements of a modern computer." <br />

			<h2>The First assembly language</h2>
			<p>
				The inventor of the first assembly language is considered to be David
				J.<br />
				Wheeler, who worked on a part of a team on the Electronic Delay
				Storage<br />
				Automatic Computer. The machine was finished in 1949 and the first<br />
				program it ran was on 9th May.Sep 15, 2015
			</p>
			<h2>The First High Level Programming Language</h2>
			<p>
				Created in 1957 by John Backus, Fortran (short for Formula Translation)
				is possibly <br />
				the oldest programming language that’s still in use today and is the
				first high <br />
				level programming langage invented. It’s designed to do complex
				statistical, <br />
				mathematical, and scientific work.
