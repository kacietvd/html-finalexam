			<h2>Career Opportunities!</h2>
			<p>
				Programmers who have general business experience may become computer
				<br />
				systems analysts. With experience, some programmers may become software
				<br />
				developers. They may also be promoted to managerial positions.There
				is<br />
				also something that wasn't mentioned in the salary page. If you are
				<br />
				decicated and become well rounded in both the front end and back end of
				<br />
				developement you may a find yourself to become a full stacked
				developer.<br />
				The average full-stack developer salary nationwide is $110,500. Again,
				<br />
				depending on region and skills, that figure can be substantially higher.
				<br />
				Some companies will pay $150,000 per year or more for developers with
				<br />
				specific expertise. It may get confusing trying to understand all the
				<br />
				titles if you are looking to get into this field it can help by <br />
				researching what jobs are thr highest paying and highest demand in your
				<br />

			<h2>Education for programmers</h2>
			<p>
				Most computer programmers have a bachelor's degree; however, some<br />
				employers hire workers who have other degrees or experience in
				specific<br />
				programming languages. Most programmers get a degree in computer
				science<br />
				or a related subject. Programmers who work in specific fields, such
				as<br />
				healthcare or accounting, may take classes in that field to
				supplement<br />
				their degree in computer programming. In addition, employers value<br />
				experience, which many students gain through internships. Most<br />
				programmers learn a few computer languages while in school. However,
				a<br />
				computer science degree gives students the skills needed to learn new<br />
				computer languages easily. Students get hands-on experience writing<br />
				code, testing programs, fixing errors, and doing many other tasks
				that<br />
				they will perform on the job. To keep up with changing technology,<br />
				computer programmers may take continuing education classes and attend<br />
				professional development seminars to learn new programming languages
				or<br />
				about upgrades to programming languages they already know.
